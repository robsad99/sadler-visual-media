     <h1>Course Description</h1>
   <p>An introduction to the visual image and visual thinking applied to photography, video, and film. Sophomore standing required. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the concepts and skills needed to succeed as producers of media, journalism, public relations, and other communication artifacts. To achieve this goal, you will frequently produce visual and written assignments in this course. In addition, you are expected to become critical consumers of media so that your own media production will be creative, accurate, ethical, and understandable.
   For this class we have four projects. The first is a magazine proposal and spread to work on our design skills in InDesign. The second project was a photo project to work on our photography editing skills in Photoshop. The third project was a video report to work on our video editing skills in Premiere. Lastly, our last project is our web presence to work on our basic coding skills in Atom and GitHub.</p>

   <h1>My Opinion of Class</h1>
   <p>At the beginning of the semester, the class seemed like it would be pretty hard and I was just hoping I would get a C to pass it as a major-specific course. However, I started practicing and working with the resources given and the class became easier the more I tried.
   It is one of my favorite classes to attend because I made some friends via group projects and Dr. Evia knows his stuff and really tries to help each student. He is my favorite professor, and I am not just saying that since this site is for his class. He comes to class each day with enthusiasm and willingness to improve each student's capabilities.
 Now, I expect and am hoping to finish with an A and I will most likely take another course with Evia, if possible.</p>
<p>The magazine spread project would have been challenging for me if I did not have a group, but thanks to them, designing and formatting in InDesign became easy and we worked well together. The photo project was the most fun as I got to take pictures of pretty much anything and I got to edit them in Photoshop, which was awesome for me.
The video project was probably the most difficult because we had to meet out of class so much for it. The video editing was challenging as well for me but I won Best Performance with my work as a ghost! Lastly, this coding project has required the most work and usage of my time but I have started to enjoy it, the more I work with it. Overall, these projects do a great job in enhancing our skills in the media world. </p>
