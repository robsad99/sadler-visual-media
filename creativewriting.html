     <h1>Creative Writing</h1>
     <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>A workshop for beginning writers who will identify and apply formal elements of a variety of genres and employ the skills, tools, methods, and iterative processes used by creative writers to produce fully developed works of art.
  We started with the fiction unit, which included writing a 6 page short story amongst other writings. Then we moved onto creative nonfiction which also included a 6 page story, along with in class assignments. Our last unit is poetry,
which includes many different types of form poems and editing. All of this culminate into a final portfolio that will contain a combination of our work from all three units.</p>

  <h2>My Opinion of Class</h2>
  <p>This is my favorite class to intend because it is the class in which I have the most freedom to be myself. I love writing more than most things in the world, and even though this class has many assignments, each one brings me joy. I expect to get an A in the class
  because if you do the assignments, besides the portfolio, you will most likely get a 100. The class also provides peer review which helps me get insight from my classmates in order to help me become a better writer. My only issue with the class is that we had to attend
two reading sessions outside of class and write a two page paper about it. I do not think that assignment brings any meaning to the class, and listening to authors read for a hour becomes boring, and you also have to remember to turn in this assignment within a week of
attending the event. Overall, I love this class and it is my favorite course, and would reccomend it to any student that enjoys writing.</p>
