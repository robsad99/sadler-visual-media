<h1> About Jenn Mackay</h1>
<p>"Journalism is an addiction.
Once someone develops the raw passion for reporting, he may never fully recover. I worked as a television journalist in Tennessee and later as a newspaper reporter in North Carolina and Virginia. I still suffer from the journalism addiction, but instead of chasing cop cars or investigating scandals, I try to help my Virginia Tech students find the same love for journalism that I still have.
 My primary research interest is journalistic ethics. I've recently focused my research on political cartoonists and the role they play in society. I've also studied influence of technology on journalists. I am currently a member of the standing committee for Professional Freedom and Responsibility for the Association for Journalism and Mass Communication. I'm the a former chair of the Media Ethics Division of the AEJMC."</p>

  <h1>My Opinion of Class</h1>
  <p>I think this teacher is great and is exciting and evokes attention and thought from the class. However, my problem with the course is the grading. Our grades are contstructed by 3 test grades and attendance/class participation. If you do bad on a test, like I have, it becomes hard to get your grade back up. The exams are pretty hard and I'm just hoping I can get a C at this point.
  Also, this is my biggest class this year with so many people, it is hard to get individualized help. There is one study session before the final but I wish they had them before each test like some of my past courses offered. Overall, I think the course offers interesting topics to be explored and is exciting to learn about, but just needs some maintenance in the structure and grading.</p>
