     <h1>My Opinion of Class</h1>
     <p>This is another online class that I took to be a GPA booster and I do expect to get an A in the class. With that being said, this is my least favorite class. Our grades are mostly discussion posts which are due on different days at different times, which makes it easy to forget. This format makes it hard for me to want to read the textbook because at times, it seems unnecessary.
     The exams are not that hard so that is a plus, but I do not really learn a lot in this class. We also have to interview a person about their sexuality and what not, which could be problematic for some people. Lastly, we have to attend a workshop on STI/ Contraceptions and then write a report about it. Although this is beneficial to all people, it can make some people feel uncomfortable
   and unwilling to participate. What is with these teachers and attending out of class workshops? Overall, this class really is an easy A if you remember to do all your work, so I would recommend it to any student that wants to take it, even for GPA purposes.</p>
