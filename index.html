     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I am a sophomore student here at Virginia Tech and I am taking five classes for the Fall 2018 semester. These classes include Visual Media, Personal Health, Media and Society, Human Sexuality, and Creative writing.
     I am majoring in multimedia journalism with a concentration in sports media and analytics. For my Visual Media class, I have created this webpage to introduce you to all the classes previously listed. A link to each class page is to the left, so please feel free to meet all of my great teachers at the best school in America!</p>
     <h2>More About Me</h2>
     <p> I am from northern Virginia and graduated from Potomac Senior High School. At Virginia Tech, I am in the NSMA and Sports Business Club where I look to further my opportunities for internships. In my free time, I like
       to play video games, recreational sports, or even go hiking. My favorite things in life is Marvel, music, and the Philadeplhia Eagles. If you want to know anything else about me, my contact information is listed at the bottom of the page.</p>
