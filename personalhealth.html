  <h2> About Amy Smith</h2>
  <p>"When I was doing public relations, my most interesting clients were the hospitals and physicians I did work for. And the fact I grew up with a health professional in the family," Smith said, responding to a question about her career path. "Health is my passion. I figured out how to make a living in a field I was really passionate about -- a little later in life -- but that's OK."
  Smith also said "I like to communicate via email because I like to write. I don't mind the communication that way and because I work from home with all my jobs, any contract I take, I'm at my computer a lot and I can answer emails on my phone. To be a successful online teacher you have to be accessible all of the time</p>
  <p>Smith was the driving force behind an in-depth, two-year study about cancer in the Mount Rogers Health District, which includes the city of Bristol, Va., along with Washington, Smyth, Wythe, Bland and Carroll counties. The study tracked cancer incidence, treatment options and challenges. It found an above average rate of lung cancer, health care options all clustered along the Interstate 81 corridor and mostly on the district's western end.
The second part of the grant-funded project was community education."The second year we went out and talked about that survey to as many groups as we possibly could. Part of the goal was to engage other people throughout the health district to develop programs or start programs to meet the needs we found," Smith said."With all the information out there, you would think people would know more, but a little residual effect was we discovered some cancers or people who had some suspected cancers came forward and we could tell them where to get a screening."</p>

  <h2>My Opinion of Class</h2>
  <p>I basically took this class to be a GPA booster because classes like this tend to be an easy A. To me, it is an easy A, but you have to do all the work. For example, you have to answer hundreds of practice questions for each chapter assigned before you can get your 100 for that chapter. Other work includes self-assessments and quizzes. I have actually learned a lot in this class due to that textbook method. It makes sure you learn what is in the chapter before you can move on. What I
  like about the class is that every due date for each block of work is given at the beginning of the semester and it is really up to the student to be on track. However, I do expect an A in the class My problem with the course is that you have to connect your account to McGraw Hill, which costs money, and as a broke college student, I did not appreciate that. Overall, I think the class provides lots of great learning for personal health and I would reccomend it to any student interested, or to any student needing a little boostto their GPA></p>
